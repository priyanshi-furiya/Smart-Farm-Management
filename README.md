# Smart Farm Management System

## Overview

This is a python program for a smart farm management system that allows farmers and customers to manage their farm related activities. 

The system has two main components - Farmer Side and Customer Side.

### Farmer Side

The farmer side allows farmers to:

- Create a farmer account by providing username, password, state, contact number, farm area and initial trust score of 0
- Login using username and password
- Add crop details like crop name, sowing date, expected harvesting date, expected yield, alerts etc.
- View and update details
- Data is stored in a SQLite database and CSV file

### Customer Side  

The customer side allows customers to:

- Create a customer account by providing username, password and contact number
- Login using username and password
- Search for farmers growing a particular crop variety 
- Search for farmers in a particular state
- View farmer details like username, contact, state and trust score
- Rate farmers after purchasing crop
- Farmer's trust score is updated based on crop quality and service ratings

## Usage

To use the system:

1. Run the python program `python smart_farm.py`

2. Choose option 1 for Farmer Side or 2 for Customer Side

### Farmer Side

3. Choose 1 to create farmer account and enter details

4. Choose 2 to login using existing username and password

5. Follow prompts to add crop details 

6. Data is stored in SQLite database `farmers_database.db` and CSV file `farmers_database.csv`

7. To update details, login again and update

### Customer Side

3. Choose 1 to create customer account and enter details 

4. Choose 2 to login using existing username and password

5. Choose 1 to search by crop or 2 to search by state 

6. View farmer details and choose farmer

7. Rate farmer after purchasing crop

8. Farmer's trust score in `farmers_database.db` gets updated

## Components

The main components used are:

- `sqlite3`: For SQLite database to store farmer and crop details

- `tkinter`: For calendar widget to choose dates

- `csv`: To store data in csv file 

- `pandas`: To read and filter data from CSV files

- `os`: To interact with file system

- `pwinput`: To masked password input

The farmer and customer data is stored in two SQLite database files `farmers_database.db` and `customers_database.db`.

The data is also exported to two CSV files `farmers_database.csv` and `customers_database.csv` for easier viewing and analysis.

Tkinter's calendar widget is used to choose sowing and harvesting dates. 

Pwinput is used to mask password input.

Pandas is used to read and filter data from the CSV files.

The system provides an easy way for farmers and consumers to manage farm activities and connect with each other.
